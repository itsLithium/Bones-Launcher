## FAQ

- Q: I have analyzed the launcher in virustotal and it has a detection, does it have viruses?
- A: As I said before, it is a virus-free launcher, and I am working on knowing why this detection is due! For now I can tell that it is a false positive, and that it is probably due to the fact that the launcher makes external downloads (Download the versions of minecraft on minecraft.net) and that can be detected as malicious behavior

- Q: Can I use your code for other things?
- A: Of course, as long as you give me credits (link the repository) and don't distribute it commercially, yes!
